# Election_Analysis

**Overview**

In this project of designing a program to calculate the total votes of an election, we used a script to take the data from a CSV file to calculate the total amount of votes that were cast for each person. The program that we had designed not only collected the votes, but it also took into account the different counties that each participant was in and how active each county was. The code that we had designed allows us to take a look at the different variables that are impactful to the election.

**Election-Audit Results**

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

    Using a FOR loop, we were able to go through the vote list and determine the total count of votes

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

    Within the FOR loop, we use an IF statement to add a count for each county that we encouter to each county separated by name

* Which county had the largest number of votes?

    Using another FOR loop, we are able to collect all the different counties votes and then determine the winning county. 
    
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
